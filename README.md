In case you want to run your Django application from the terminal just run:

1) Run syncdb command to sync models to database and create Django's default superuser and auth system

    $ python manage.py migrate

2) Run Django

    $ python manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT
    
## Overview for this branch

Django provides an authentication and authorisation ("permission") system, built on top of the session framework discussed in the previous tutorial, that allows you to verify user credentials and define what actions each user is allowed to perform. The framework includes built-in models for Users and Groups (a generic way of applying permissions to more than one user at a time), permissions/flags that designate whether a user may perform a task, forms and views for logging in users, and view tools for restricting content.



The current user's permissions are stored in a template variable called {{ perms }}. You can check whether the current user has a particular permission using the specific variable name within the associated Django "app" â€” e.g. {{ perms.catalog.can_mark_returned }} will be True if the user has this permission, and False otherwise. We typically test for the permission using the template {% if %} tag as shown:
```
{% if perms.catalog.can_mark_returned %}
    <!-- We can mark a BookInstance as returned. -->
    <!-- Perhaps add code to link to a "book return" view here. -->
{% endif %}

```

Permissions can be tested in function view using the permission_required decorator or in a class-based view using the PermissionRequiredMixin. The pattern and behaviour are the same as for login authentication, though of course you might reasonably have to add multiple permissions.

Function view decorator:

```

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required

@permission_required('catalog.can_mark_returned')
@permission_required('catalog.can_edit')
def my_view(request):
    ...
Permission-required mixin for class-based views.

from django.contrib.auth.mixins import PermissionRequiredMixin

class MyView(PermissionRequiredMixin, View):
    permission_required = 'catalog.can_mark_returned'
    # Or multiple permissions
    permission_required = ('catalog.can_mark_returned', 'catalog.can_edit')
    # Note that 'catalog.can_edit' is just an example
    # the catalog application doesn't have such permission!
    
```
